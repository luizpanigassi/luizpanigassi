## 📌 Featured Project

### [minishell42](https://github.com/luizpanigassi/minishell42)

A collaborative project developed as part of the 42 São Paulo curriculum. `minishell42` is a minimalist shell implemented in C, designed to mimic basic functionalities of the Unix Bash shell. Key features include:

- Execution of system and local commands
- Implementation of built-in commands: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`
- Support for pipes (`|`) and redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`)
- Handling of environment variables and command-line parsing
- Signal handling for `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, and `Ctrl-\`

This project provided hands-on experience with process management, file descriptors, and the intricacies of shell behavior.
